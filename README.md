üìä Project: Analyses of Nile's Customer Service Data using Microsoft Excel


üìù Description: 

iVision is a well-known analytics firm. iVision does analytics on the data shared by their clients. Recently, iVision collaborated with Nile, an E-commerce company. Nile intends to improve their customer service, but before doing so, Nile wants to get some insights on their customer service request data. To help Nile make better business decisions and improve their services, iVision is engaged to provide Nile access to the analytics dashboard and report. Nile has shared its customer service data with iVision.
As an employee of iVision, Our responsibility is to create the analytics report.


üîÑ CRISP-DM Methodology:

The choice of analytics framework for a task or project depends on the specific objectives, complexity, and nature of the project. Here we‚Äôll be using CRISP-DM for this Project.

CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It's a widely used methodology in the field of data mining and analytics. The approach is a structured and comprehensive way to guide professionals through the stages of a data mining project, from understanding the business problem to deploying the results.

CRISP-DM is iterative, meaning it‚Äôs common for the process to cycle back to previous stages as new insights are gained or as requirements change. The flexibility of this methodology allows data scientists and analysts to adapt and refine their approach based on the ongoing analysis and evolving business needs.

The CRISP-DM process consists of six main phases.

üîç Features:

1. Business Understanding: This initial phase involves understanding the project objectives, requirements, and determining how data mining can provide solutions to the business problem.
 
   Business Objective:
   
   The analysis aims to leverage data-driven approaches to optimize customer service processes, enhance customer experience, and drive overall business growth. By examining historical customer service data, the project seeks to identify 
   patterns, trends, and opportunities for improvement, ultimately leading to enhanced customer loyalty and increased operational efficiency. 

   Project Goals:
   
     A Customer Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on customer interactions. Identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed by customers to understand overall satisfaction levels. 
  
     B Root Cause Analysis: Investigate common customer complaints. Pinpoint recurring problems to address them proactively and prevent future escalations. 
  
     C Service Response Time Analysis: Analyse response times for customer queries and support requests to assess the efficiency of the customer service team.
  
     D Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their demographics, behaviour, and preferences. Understand different customer segments' needs and pain points to tailor services and communications accordingly. 
  
     E Trends and Patterns Identification: Identify patterns and trends in customer service data to uncover opportunities for process improvements and innovative service offerings.

2. Data Understanding: In this phase, data collection, exploration, and initial data quality assessment take place. It involves understanding the available data sources, their quality, and their potential to meet the project objectives.
   Here we have the original data file which will show what is the task which we have to perform and how we have to proceed with it.

3. Data Preparation: This phase involves cleaning, transforming, and pre-processing the data to make it suitable for analysis. Tasks include dealing with correction of file type, missing 
   values, handling outliers, removing duplicates and transforming data into a usable format.

4. Modeling: In this phase, various modeling techniques are selected and applied to the prepared dataset. Different algorithms and methodologies are used to build and assess models based on the business problem.

   For this project we have use different Pivot tables, charts and slicers according to the requirement and analysis.
    
    We have in total of five goals that we have to achieve based on the given data :

   A. Customer Sentiment Analysis :

    Here we have performed sentiment analysis on customer interactions through Pie chart and Identified positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed by customers to understand overall satisfaction 
    levels.
