üîÑ CRISP-DM Methodology:
The choice of analytics framework for a task or project depends on the specific objectives, complexity, and nature of the project. Here we‚Äôll be using CRISP-DM for this Project.
CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It's a widely used methodology in the field of data mining and analytics. The approach is a structured and comprehensive way to guide professionals through the stages of a data mining project, from understanding the business problem to deploying the results. The CRISP-DM process consists of six main phases.
CRISP-DM is iterative, meaning it‚Äôs common for the process to cycle back to previous stages as new insights are gained or as requirements change. The flexibility of this methodology allows data scientists and analysts to adapt and refine their approach based on the ongoing analysis and evolving business needs.
